      <h3>Ballerina Cappucina</h3>

      <p>
        Ballerina Cappucina is an omnidirectional autonomous robot designed
        to navigate freely across a defined arena while detecting and
        collecting colored objects.
      </p>

      <p>
        I led the mechanical design and implementation of the robot’s
        omnidirectional drive system, including chassis design, motor
        selection, and drivetrain integration to achieve smooth
        multi-directional movement without requiring chassis reorientation.
        The mechanical structure was designed to ensure stability,
        maneuverability, and reliable object collection.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the perception side, I contributed to the development of a vision
        pipeline using OpenCV for detecting and identifying colored objects
        in real time. I was also involved in overall system integration,
        assisting with software development and testing to ensure seamless
        interaction between motion, perception, and object collection modules.

    <!-- WALL-E -->
    <div class="project-detailed">

      <h3>Wall-E Robot Platform</h3>

      <p>
        Wall-E is a two-wheeled self-balancing and line-following robot
        platform developed within SRA-VJTI to demonstrate embedded robotics
        and control system concepts.
      </p>

      <p>
        I worked extensively on hardware assembly and integration of the
        robot using an ESP32-based SRA development board. I implemented and
        tuned PID control algorithms to achieve stable self-balancing
        behaviour and reliable line-following performance using real-time
        sensor feedback.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond development, I played an active role in mentoring and
        teaching. I conducted robotics workshops alongside my peers,
        guiding students through the hardware assembly process, explaining
        firmware structure, and helping them understand control system
        implementation.
