    <!-- Intro -->
    <h1>Hi, I’m Lakshya.</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      I’m an Electronics & Telecommunication engineering student interested in
      building systems that sit at the intersection of hardware and software.
      <br><br>
      I work with robotics, ROS 2 simulations, embedded systems, FPGA-based
      digital design, and RF technology — usually starting from first principles
      and figuring things out by building and testing.
      <br><br>
      This website is a record of my projects, experiments, and learning journey
      as I turn theory into working systems.

    <h2>Ongoing Work</h2>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>UWB-Based Ranging & Localization</h3>
      <p>
        Exploring ultra-wideband (UWB) technology for accurate distance
        measurement and localization using time-based ranging techniques.
        <br><br>
        The project involves understanding the underlying RF principles,
        experimenting with ranging methods, and integrating UWB modules
        into a larger embedded and robotics-oriented system.

    <div class="project">
      <h3>FPGA-Based Software Defined Radio</h3>
      <p>
        Working on an FPGA-based software defined radio to better understand
        digital communication systems from the hardware level upward.
        <br><br>
        This includes implementing and testing signal processing blocks in
        hardware, studying data paths and timing constraints, and connecting
        theory from communications courses to real digital implementations.
