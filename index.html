    <h1>Lakshya Lalwani</h1>
    <h2>always building.</h2>

    <p class="intro">
      I’m Lakshya, an Electronics & Telecommunication engineering student
      passionate about building systems at the intersection of hardware
      and software.
      <br><br>
      I like making robots — hopefully ones that move later on :) Other
      than that, I love learning about wireless communication and the
      electronics that support it.
      <br><br>
      I usually learn by experimenting, building things, breaking them,
      and improving them step by step.
